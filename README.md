# JS-PDF-Invoices-generator
Application for creating and downloading invoices (React+Material-UI, NodeJS + ExpressJS + MySQL)

My first project created with React and Node.JS. 
It's an application where user can create invoices which are stored in database, 
download them in PDF and display statistics charts about income, best customers, most lucrative services and more.
Application can also work in offline mode - then all changes are temporarly saved in Local Storage 
and automatically sent to server after connection is recovered. Used technologies: React, Node.JS + ExpressJs, MySQL
